## Key Features

1. **Low Peer Count Alert**  
   Automatically notifies you when your node loses peers, ensuring you‚Äôre aware of potential connectivity issues.

3. **Node Sync Alert**  
   Triggers a notification if your node falls behind the network (by more than 50 blocks), so you can take immediate corrective actions.

4. **No Archival Peers Alert**  
   Warns you if the monitored node is not running in archival mode, allowing you to address potential data unavailability issues.

5. **Resolved Messages**  
   Whenever a previously detected issue has been resolved, the service issues a ‚Äúresolved‚Äù message, confirming that normal operations have been restored.

6. **Support for Mainnet and Testnet**

## Examples

Below are real-world screenshots illustrating how to interact with the Celestia DA Metrics Checker through its commands and alerts.

### Examples

#### 1. Subscribing to a Node
<img width="873" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0bbfef2-b640-4f61-9f9f-a956083142cf" />
<img width="856" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab093e41-6297-4101-aec3-0c62a6af6d38" />



In this screenshot, the user runs the `subscribe` command to begin monitoring a specific DA Node.  
- **Command Used:** `/subscribe`  
- **Outcome:** The bot confirms a successful subscription and provides the node‚Äôs unique identifier (`12D3K...`), confirming that any alerts or updates for this node will now be sent to the user.


#### 2. Unsubscribing from a Node
<img width="866" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed48b9b4-b9d0-4943-98ae-aee3f9da7d83" />
<img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53eaf2ba-4139-426a-846b-fd5edc8d6cff" />



Here, the user decides to stop monitoring a previously subscribed node.  
- **Command Used:** `/unsubscribe`  
- **Outcome:** The bot notifies the user that they have successfully unsubscribed from the specified node (`12D3K...`). Any alerts associated with this node will no longer be delivered.


#### 3. Viewing Node Information
<img width="866" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/546bb0e6-a386-4e1a-8060-07be084ea300" />



Using the `info` command, the user obtains detailed data for all subscribed nodes.  
- **Command Used:** `/info`  
- **Information Returned:**  
  - **Node ID:** `12D3K...`
  - **Node Type:** `Bridge`
  - **Alerts:** `üü¢ Your node is synced and have no active alerts.`
  - **Build Version:** `v0.22.2`  
  - **Go Version:** `go1.21.3`  
  - **Last Commit:** `d57107...`  
  - **Build Time:** `Fri Feb 7 17:21:23 UTC 2025`  
  - **System Version:** `amd64/linux`

This overview helps users quickly verify that the node‚Äôs software and environment match their expectations.


#### 4. Receiving an Alert
<img width="1114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf2b0cc8-806f-4224-b1aa-b2105e9ebef9" />


When the bot detects a potential issue‚Äîsuch as the node falling more than 50 blocks behind‚Äîit automatically sends an alert to prompt swift action.  
- **Alert Message:** **Warning! Node Sync Alert**  
- **Details:** The node `12D3K...` is out of sync, indicating that it lags behind the current block height.  
- **User Tag:** The message includes a tag (e.g., `@d`) to ensure the relevant user is immediately informed.


#### 5. Receiving a Resolve Message
<img width="1114" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/066f7c77-348b-4303-b550-e269aa4db963" />

Once the bot confirms that a previously alerted condition is resolved, it sends a ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù message.  
- **Resolved Message:** **Resolved! Node Sync Alert**  
- **Details:** The node `12D3K...` is now synchronized.  
- **Significance:** This quick confirmation gives users peace of mind that their node has recovered without needing to check manually.

These examples demonstrate how Celestia Bridge Metrics Checker streamlines node monitoring, enabling you to respond rapidly to any issues and stay updated when they are resolved.
